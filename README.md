*Still Being Updated* MSDscript is a sophisticated interpreter designed for the dynamic parsing, evaluation, and printing of user inputs. IT leverages a custom parsing algorithm that efficiently interprets expressions and commands, facilitating the rapid development and testing of code in a controlled environment.

When the "--interp" flag is called the program uses parsing to recognize keywords like "_let" and "_in" to evaluate complex expressions correctly. Simple arithmetic expressions are supported as well.

"--print" flag accepts expressions, parses them (including skipping whitespaces), and prints with correct arithmetic grammar.
